The experiments provided in this repository are intended to be executed using Microsoft Azure platform. The following is a link setting up a Azure Machine Learning Studio, from which the Azure machine learning classic studio experiments can be completed and run.
### Log in to the Azure ML console and create a notebook instance

Log in to the [Microsoft Azure machine learning](Azure Machine Learning Studio ) and go to the Experiments tab. Click on 'Create a new experiment.

Project Objectives

* Build a predictive model using Azure ML Studio.
* Demonstrate a working knowledge of setting up experiments on Azure ML Studio.
