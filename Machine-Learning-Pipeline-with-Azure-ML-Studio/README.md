The experiments provided in this repository are intended to be executed using Microsoft Azure platform. The following is a link setting up a Azure Machine Learning Studio , from which the Azure machine learning classic studio experiments can be completed and run.
### Log in to the Azure ML console and create a notebook instance

Log in to the [Microsoft Azure machine learning](Azure Machine Learning Studio ) and go to the Experiments tab. Click on 'Create a new experiment.

Project Objectives
* Pre-process data using appropriate modules
* Train and evaluate a boosted decision tree model on Azure ML Studio.
* Create scoring and predictive experiments.
* Deploy the trained model as an Azure web service

### Open and run the your experiments
The following tasks are to be completed:

* Introduction
* Data Cleaning
* Accounting for Class Imbalance
* Training a Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree Model and Hyperparameter Tuning
* Publishing the Trained Model as a Web Service for Inference
